This repository contains an implementation of sentiment analysis using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. Sentiment analysis, is the process of determining the emotional tone behind a piece of text, whether it's positive, negative, or neutral.

Overview
Sentiment analysis is a popular application of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. This project focuses on utilizing LSTM, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), to perform sentiment analysis on textual data.

Requirements
To run the code in this repository, you need:

Python 3.x
TensorFlow 2.x
Keras
NumPy
Pandas
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
You can install the required packages using pip:


Model Architecture
The LSTM model architecture consists of an embedding layer, LSTM layers, and a dense layer. The embedding layer converts each word into a vector representation, which is then passed to the LSTM layers to capture the sequential information in the text. Finally, the output of the LSTM layers is fed into a dense layer for classification.

Usage
To train the sentiment analysis model, follow these steps:

Prepare your dataset and ensure it is properly labeled for sentiment analysis.
Preprocess the text data (tokenization, padding, etc.).
Define the LSTM model architecture.
Train the model on the training data.
Evaluate the model performance on the test data.
You can use the provided scripts and notebooks in this repository as a reference for implementing sentiment analysis using LSTM.
